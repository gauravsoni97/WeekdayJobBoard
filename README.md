# Candidate Application Platform

Welcome to our Candidate Application Platform! This platform allows users to view job listings, filter jobs based on various criteria, and implement infinite scroll for a seamless browsing experience.

## Features

### 1. Job Cards

Each job listing is displayed as a card containing the following information:
- **Job title**
- **Company name**
- **Location**
- **Job description** 
- **Experience required**
- **Apply button/link**

### 2. Filters

Filters are implemented to allow users to refine the job listings based on:
- **Minimum experience**
- **Company name**
- **Location**
- **Remote/on-site**
- **Role**
- **Minimum base pay**

### 3. Infinite Scroll

Implemented infinite scroll to load additional job listings as the user scrolls down the page. The platform fetches and displays more jobs automatically without requiring the user to click a "Load More" button.

### 4. Responsive Design

The responsive platform works well on different screen sizes, including mobile devices.
